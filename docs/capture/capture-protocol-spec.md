# OpenStage Capture: Protocol Specification

**Status:** v0.1 (matches the code in `capture/crates/openstage-capture-protocol`)
**Protocol version string:** `0.1`

This page describes how OpenStage talks to the recording program, `openstage-capture`. The program has no window of its own. OpenStage starts it, tells it what to do, and shows the author what it reports. If this page and the code ever disagree, that is a bug; fix both in the same change.

## 1. The shape of the conversation

- **One JSON object per line, in both directions.** A line ends with a newline (`\n`). A carriage return before it (`\r\n`) is also accepted.
- **Events** go from the program to OpenStage, on the program's **standard output**.
- **Commands** go from OpenStage to the program, on the program's **standard input**.
- **Logs and diagnostics** go to **standard error**. Standard output carries events and nothing else.
- **Longest line:** 64 KiB (65,536 bytes), in both directions. A longer command is ignored and answered with a warning. The program never keeps an over-long line in memory.
- **Text encoding:** UTF-8.
- **Names:** field names use camelCase. Event and command names are camelCase too.

### Rules that let the protocol grow

1. The **first line** the program prints is always a `hello` event. A reader checks `protocol` before trusting anything else.
2. A reader **must ignore event types it does not know** and **fields it does not know**.
3. The program **ignores extra fields** in commands. A command it does not understand gets a `bad-command` warning, never a crash.
4. While recording, the **last line** is a `result` event, and then the program exits.
5. A change that older readers could misread bumps the protocol version.

## 2. Starting the program

```
openstage-capture probe
openstage-capture record --project <folder> [options]
openstage-capture recover --project <folder>

openstage-capture render --project <folder> --out <file> [options]  (Windows only; turns a recording or an edit into a finished MP4)
```

### Diagnostics on standard error

Standard error is for diagnostics, never for OpenStage to parse: timing lines while recording and exporting (`preparing:`, `start-up:`, `resources at ...`, `export: ...`), and, on Windows, one line beginning `THE PROGRAM STOPPED SUDDENLY` if Windows itself ends the program (for example because it used memory it must not), giving Windows' error code, the address and the file the fault was in. That last line is the only sign of such an end: the program cannot send a protocol event at that moment, so a reader that sees standard output close without a `result` should look at standard error. The test scripts keep standard error in their logs.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | It worked. |
| 1 | Something went wrong (a `fatal` error event was printed first). |
| 2 | Not available: an unknown source, or a command that needs Windows (`render`, `screen-test` and the other tests of Windows' video, sound and cameras) on a computer that is not running Windows. |

### Options for `audio-test`

Listens to the default microphone and to what the computer is playing (the default sound output, including a screen reader's speech) and reports each finding as a `check` event. It records no picture and does not make a capture project. Sound is requested from Windows as 16-bit stereo at 48,000 samples per second; Windows converts from what the device really uses.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--seconds` | 8 | How long to listen (between 1 and 600). |
| `--out` | `audio-test-output` | Folder for `mic.wav`, `system.wav`, and `both.wav`. They contain your voice and what the computer played, so they are private. |
| `--microphone` | `default` | Which microphone: its number from `audio-devices`, part of its name (capital letters do not matter), or `default`. |
| `--output` | `default` | Which sound output to listen to, chosen the same way. Windows listens to one output at a time, so these test commands keep to the output they started on. |
| `--plain` | off | Print sentences for a person instead of JSON events. |

The checks, in order: `audio-devices` (every microphone and sound output, numbered, with the default marked), `microphone-start`, `system-audio-start` (each names the device found, or says why listening could not start, with advice for the usual cause), `microphone` and `system-audio` (the loudest moment in words, or "heard nothing" with advice), `audio-clock` (the microphone's sound card clock compared with the computer's: fine within 250 milliseconds), `balance` (only when both sounds were heard: how loud the voice and the computer's sound are next to each other while each is making sound, in the mix inside the video, that is after any `--mic-gain-db` and `--system-gain-db`; it also says what the difference was as heard. It fails with the setting to try when the computer's sound is as loud as the voice or within 3 decibels of it), `echo` (only when both sounds were heard: whether the microphone's loudness follows the computer's, which means it is hearing the speakers; it fails with advice about headphones when an echo is likely, and says plainly when there was too little computer sound to tell), and `audio-saved`. The saved files hold what a recording would hold: each track as long as the real time, with silence filled in where Windows delivered nothing (it sends nothing for a quiet sound output). Exit codes are as for `screen-test`.

### `audio-devices`

Lists the microphones and sound outputs the computer has, numbered within their kind in the order Windows lists them, with the default marked, as one `check` named `audio-devices`. The numbers are what `--microphone` and `--output` take. Exit codes are as for `screen-test`. `probe` also lists them, as `microphone:N` and `output:N`, with `available` true on Windows and a note giving the options to record them (`record --source screen --microphone N`).

A name Windows will not give is not hidden: it is shown as `microphone 1 (its name could not be read: <reason>)` (or `sound output N`), so the numbering and the choice still work. Windows is asked for three different name properties before giving up.

### `find-output`

Windows listens to one sound output at a time, and a computer often has many (speakers, headphones, monitors, virtual devices). `find-output` listens to every sound output at the same time for `--seconds` (default 6, between 1 and 120) while something audible plays, and reports which of them carried sound. It saves nothing. The checks, in order: `audio-devices`, `outputs-tried` (how many outputs it could listen to; ones that cannot be listened to, often virtual, are named but are not a failure unless none could be listened to), and `sound-found` (passes and names each output that carried sound, with its number and level, and says "To record it, choose sound output number N" when exactly one did; fails and asks for something to be playing when none did). Exit codes are as for `screen-test`; it exits 1 when no output carried sound.

### `timing-test`

Measures, for `--seconds` (default 10), how late the picture and the sound reach the program after Windows captured them, and whether the picture and sound clocks agree. Options: `--display` (1), `--microphone` and `--output` (as for `audio-test`), `--plain`. It saves nothing. Windows stamps every picture and every packet of sound with the moment it was captured, on the computer's high resolution clock; the program stamps the moment each arrived. The difference is the "lateness". The checks: `timing-video`, `timing-microphone`, `timing-system-audio` (each says how many readings, the usual lateness, the range, and the lateness that 95 out of 100 readings stayed within; a lateness that is negative or longer than a second means the stamps are not on the computer's clock, and that stream fails with a plain message), `timing-video-stamps` (only if some pictures had no capture time), and `timing-sync`, one for the microphone and one for the computer's sound: how much later or earlier than the picture it belongs with that sound arrives. In a recording placed by arrival that is how far out of step they would be. Passing is within 40 milliseconds. It fails with advice (place picture and sound by their capture times) otherwise. Exit codes are as for `screen-test`.

### `recorder-crash-test`

Starts the real recorder (`record --source screen`) with the chosen microphone and sound output, records through a 2 second pause, kills it without warning after `--seconds-before-kill` (default 12, at least 8), then repairs the project the way `recover` does and looks at every file. Options: `--display`, `--microphone`, `--output` (a number, part of a name, `default`, or `none`), `--out` (default `recorder-crash-output`), `--plain`. The recording is real, so the folder is private. The recorder's own diagnostic notes are saved in `recorder-diagnostics.txt` there. The checks: `crash-test` (what was chosen, then how long it recorded), `crash-recover` (the take was recovered; anything repair reported), `crash-video` (Windows reads the repaired video), `crash-video-sound` (it has a sound track), `crash-microphone-file` and `crash-system-file` (each WAV file plays), `crash-loss` (the shortest saved file against the recording time: fine within 3 seconds, the product allows 10), and `crash-in-step` (the saved files within 2.5 seconds of each other in length). Exit codes are as for `screen-test`.

### `cue-test`

Plays the recorder's own cue sounds one at a time, in the order a recording uses them, and says in words what each is before it sounds. Options: `--volume` (0 to 100, default 70), `--out` (default `cue-test-output`: each sound is also saved there as a small WAV file, so it can be opened in any player; this works on every system), `--plain`. The checks: `cue-volume`, then for each of `cue-countdown`, `cue-start`, `cue-pause`, `cue-resume`, `cue-stop` and `cue-error` a sentence ("Next: the start sound. It is three rising notes... It lasts 340 milliseconds.") sent before the sound, and `cue-files`. A sound Windows would not play is a failed check (`cue-<name>-played`). Exit codes are as for `screen-test`; on a system that is not Windows the files are still written and the exit code is 2.

### `setup-check`

Looks at the computer and says whether it is ready to record (story A9). It records nothing, asks Windows for no permission, and sends nothing anywhere. Options: `--dir` (default the current folder: where recordings will be kept, whose drive's free space is reported), `--plain`. The checks, in order: `windows-version` (Windows 11 or later), `screen-capture` (Windows' screen capture is available) and `displays`, `video-encoder` (an H.264 encoder exists, hardware or software) and `sound-encoder` (an AAC encoder exists); both of these name the Media Feature Pack when missing, because some "N" editions of Windows come without Windows' media parts; `microphone` and `sound-output` (found, with the defaults named; a missing one is reported but is not a failure, because a recording can be made without a voice or without the computer's sound), `microphone-access` (fails when the Windows privacy settings block microphone use for desktop programs, with the setting to change; passes with a note when Windows does not say), `camera` (the cameras found, or that none was; never a failure, because a webcam is recorded only when asked for) and `camera-access` (sent only when a camera was found: says whether Windows lets desktop programs use cameras, with the setting to change when it does not; also never a failure, since a recording without a webcam is not affected) and `disk-space` (fails below 2 gigabytes free; otherwise says about how many hours that is, at about 5 gigabytes an hour). Exit codes are as for `screen-test`. `CHECK MY COMPUTER.bat` runs it.

### `windows`

Lists the open windows that can be recorded (story A1), numbered from 1 in the order Windows stacks them, the one in front first. Each is written out as `number. program: title (width by height)`, so the list reads well aloud. It follows what Alt+Tab shows: visible windows that are not minimized, not hidden on another virtual desktop, with a title, that are not tool windows and not owned by another window; the desktop itself and this program's own windows are left out. Option: `--plain`. It sends one `check` named `windows` (how many can be recorded, or why none can) and then one `check` named `window` for each. Exit code 0, 1 when there are none or Windows would not list them, 2 when this is not Windows.

### `cameras`

Lists the cameras this computer has (story A2), numbered from 1 in the order Windows lists them, to choose one with `record --camera`. Each is written out as `number. name`. Option: `--plain`. It sends one `check` named `cameras`: `ok` is true with a sentence that lists them (`3 cameras were found: 1. NexiGo Iris 4K Webcam; 2. ...`), or false with a sentence that says none was found and what to check (that it is plugged in, listed in Windows' Settings and not in use by another program), or that Windows would not list them. Exit code 0 when there is at least one, 1 when there is none or Windows would not list them, 2 when this is not Windows.

### `interactions`

Reads back what was noted of the author's mouse and keyboard (story A6), and deletes it. It records nothing and works on any system. Options: `--project` (the recording folder; required), `--take` (one take by number; the default is every take), `--list` (print every line of the log as a sentence, the keys included; without it only counts and names are printed, and the keys are counted but not printed), `--with-moves` (with `--list`: the cursor's positions too, about thirty a second while it moves), `--delete` (remove what was noted of the mouse and keyboard from the chosen takes: every line except the author's own markers, and the take's entry for the log in `take.json`; the video and sound are not touched), `--yes` and `--plain`. Without `--yes`, `--delete` deletes nothing: it sends a `check` named `interactions-delete` with `ok` false that lists the takes and how many lines each would lose, and says to run the command again with `--yes`. A take that is still being recorded, or that stopped before it was finished, is never changed (repair it with `recover` first). Checks sent: `interactions-log` (one per take: the counts, the windows that were in front and the items clicked), `interactions-list` (with `--list`: the lines, one sentence each), `interactions-delete`. Exit code 0 when everything asked for was done, 1 otherwise (including a deletion that still needs `--yes`).

### `pick-region`

Lets the author choose the part of a display to record, by dragging or by typing (story A1), and gives back the four numbers `--region` takes. Options: `--display` (default 1), `--region` (start from this rectangle instead of the middle of the display; one that does not fit the display is ignored), `--out` (save the chosen numbers in this file as `left,top,width,height` on one line, ended with a carriage return and a line feed so a batch file can read it), `--plain`. It sends one `check`, named `region-chosen`: `ok` is true with a sentence that says what was chosen and the `--region` to use (and what was changed to make the size even), or false if the picker was closed without choosing, the display or start could not be used, or the picker could not open. Exit code 0 when a region was chosen, 1 when not, 2 when this is not Windows. With `--plain` the last line is `A region was chosen.` or `No region was chosen.`

Two windows open on the chosen display. An **overlay** dims it and shows the rectangle with a white border and eight handles (the four corners and the middle of each side): drag inside to move it, drag a handle to resize it, drag on the dimmed part to draw a new rectangle. It never leaves the display and is never smaller than 64 by 64. A small **window of numbers**, made of ordinary Windows controls so that the keyboard and screen readers work with it, has the four boxes Left, Top, Width and Height, a box (read only, reachable with Tab) that says in words what is chosen or what is wrong, and the buttons "Use this region" (Enter), "Whole display" and "Cancel" (Escape). Dragging changes the numbers and typing changes the rectangle. An unusable choice sounds the Windows alert and is explained in the box; nothing closes until a usable region is used or the window is cancelled. The overlay never takes the keyboard.

### `render`

Turns a recording, or an edit, into a finished MP4 (story F1). Windows only. Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--project` | required | The capture project folder (where the recordings are). |
| `--out` | required | Where the finished video goes. The folder is made if it does not exist. |
| `--edit` | the project's `edit.json` | The edit to export. With no `edit.json`, and no `--take`, the command says there is no edit and what to do. |
| `--take` | none | Instead of an edit, export this take as it was recorded: the screen, the voice, the computer's sound and the webcam, each whole, on their own tracks. It cannot be combined with `--edit`. A take that was set aside, or that stopped without finishing, is refused in words (repair it with `recover`). |
| `--demo` | off | With `--take`: also add a title, a red box, a yellow ellipse, a green arrow, a blurred patch, a blacked-out patch and a zoom into the top left quarter, at fixed fractions of the take, so that each can be seen to be drawn. For testing the exporter. |
| `--assets` | none | Where the course's own files are (pictures and sounds an edit imports). An edit that uses one without it is told so. |
| `--fps` | 30 | Pictures per second in the video. |
| `--size` | the first picture | The video's size, such as `1280x720` (both sides even, at least 64). Without it the video is the size of the first picture on the screen track (a webcam alone: the webcam's). |
| `--reduce-motion` | off | Use cuts instead of animated zooms. |
| `--allow-unfinished` | off | Export an edit that is sound but still lacks things OpenStage requires (alt text, descriptions). Without it, such an edit is refused with what is missing. |
| `--plain` | off | Sentences for a person instead of JSON events. |

The video is written to a file beside `<out>` whose name has `.part` before the final `.mp4` (`lesson.mp4` is written as `lesson.part.mp4`; the name must end in `.mp4` because Windows' video writer chooses the kind of file from the end of the name) and renamed to `<out>` only when it is whole, so a cancelled or failed export deletes the `.part.mp4` file and leaves any earlier video at `<out>` exactly as it was. Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+Break) asks the export to stop; it stops before the next picture, deletes its half-made file and says so. A program that is killed outright leaves a `.part` file behind, which the next export deletes. How the pictures are drawn and the sound is mixed is in `docs/capture-edit-format.md`, section 5b.

It sends, in order: a `check` named `edit` (which edit is being exported and how long it is, or why there is none); `progress` events (about every tenth of the way, see below); a `check` named `export` (what was made: the length, the number of pictures, the size, the rate, whether it has sound and where it is, or why it failed or was cancelled); then the read-back, the same way the recorder reads back a recording: `video-readback` (Windows opens the finished video the way a player would; its length must match to within 0.7 seconds), `video-size` (its size is the size asked for) and `audio-readback` (its sound track is as long as the video, sent only when it has sound); and last a `check` named `export-note`, not ok, for each thing the author should know about the result (so far: a text overlay whose words do not fit its box and are cut off). Notes do not change the exit code, because the exporter did its job; with `--plain` they are said as `Note:`. Exit code 0 when the video was made and read back as it should, 1 when it was not, 2 when this is not Windows. **Hidden option `--picture-reader rgb32|nv12`** (default `rgb32`): how the recorded videos are read back. With `rgb32` Windows decodes the pictures and converts their colours; with `nv12` Windows only decodes and this program converts the colours itself (BT.709 or BT.601 as the video says, limited or full range). Either way the pictures are cut to the size the video is shown at: H.264 pictures are coded in blocks of 16, so a 1080 line video is decoded as 1088 lines, and the last 8 are padding. The option exists because the first Windows run made the program stop inside Windows' file reader (`mfreadwrite.dll`) with the first way; `TEST EXPORT.bat` switches to `nv12` by itself if the log says the program stopped suddenly. The export opens every recording and reads its first picture before it makes the video file, and writes timed `export:` lines on standard error (see the diagnostics section).

### `video-info`

Opens a saved video the way a player would and reports how many pictures and seconds it holds, as one `check` named `video-info`. Exit codes are as for `screen-test`.

### Options for `screen-test`

Tries screen capture on this computer and reports each finding as a `check` event. It does not make a capture project.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | 1 | Which display to capture. Display 1 is the main display; the others follow left to right. |
| `--seconds` | 5 | How long to capture (between 0.5 and 600). |
| `--out` | `screen-test-output` | Folder for `first.bmp` and `last.bmp`, the first and last pictures. They show the screen, so they are private. |
| `--with-cursor` | off | Draw the mouse pointer in the pictures. Off by default because the pointer is recorded separately, so it can be enlarged or highlighted when editing. |
| `--plain` | off | Print sentences for a person (`OK: ...` or `PROBLEM: ...`) instead of JSON events. No `hello` line is printed in this mode. |

The checks, in order: `windows-version`, `capture-support`, `displays`, `screen-capture`, `frame-rate`, `pictures-saved`. It stops at the first check that makes the rest meaningless (for example, no screen capture support). Exit code 0 means every check was fine, 1 means at least one found a problem.

Windows sends a new picture only when something on the screen changes, so a still screen gives few pictures. The `frame-rate` check therefore needs something moving on screen, and says so when it reports a low rate.

### Options for `video-test`

Records a short MP4 video of one display with Windows' own video tools and reports each finding as a `check` event. It records no sound and does not make a capture project.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | 1 | Which display to record (1 is the main display). |
| `--seconds` | 8 | How long to record (between 1 and 600). |
| `--fps` | 30 | Pictures per second in the video. The screen only sends a picture when something changes, so the newest picture is repeated to keep the rate steady. |
| `--bitrate-kbps` | 8000 | Video quality, in kilobits per second. |
| `--fragmented` | off | Write a crash-safe fragmented MP4 (`test_fragmented.mp4`): a setup box and then short, self-contained fragments, about one a second, so a file cut off by a crash still plays up to the last whole fragment. |
| `--out` | `video-test-output` | Folder for `test.mp4` (or `test_fragmented.mp4`). The video shows the screen, so it is private. |
| `--plain` | off | Print sentences for a person instead of JSON events. No `hello` line is printed in this mode. |

The checks, in order: `media-foundation`, `h264-encoder`, `video-encode`, `video-readback` (Windows opens the finished file the way a player would and counts the pictures; they must match what was written, within 5 percent), `cpu-use`, `mp4-file`. It stops at the first check that makes the rest meaningless. `video-encode` is not fine if more than 10 percent of the beats were skipped because the computer could not keep up. `cpu-use` is not fine above 10 percent of the computer's total processing capacity (the product's target for 1080p at 30 pictures per second). Exit code 0 means every check was fine, 1 means at least one found a problem, 2 means the computer is not running Windows.

### Options for `video-crash-test`

Tests crash safety on this computer. It starts a recording of one display as a fragmented MP4 (the same as `video-test --fragmented`), waits until the file appears, lets it record, then **kills the recording program without warning** (the way a crash or a power cut would), and looks at what is left. Only the test's own recording process is stopped.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | 1 | Which display to record. |
| `--seconds-before-kill` | 8 | How long to let it record before the kill (between 2 and 60). |
| `--out` | `video-crash-output` | Folder for `test_fragmented.mp4`. It shows the screen, so it is private. |
| `--plain` | off | Print sentences for a person instead of JSON events. |

The checks, in order: `crash-test` (the recording ran and was killed), `crash-scan` (how many complete fragments the file holds and whether it ends cleanly), `crash-read-as-is` (whether Windows can play the file exactly as the crash left it), `crash-repair` (cutting off only the unfinished last piece), `crash-read-after-repair`, and `crash-loss` (how many seconds of recording were lost; fine if no more than 3, while the product allows at most 10). The recorded time is measured from the moment the recording program signals that recording began (it creates a small marker file, `recording-started.txt`, in the output folder), to the kill, so it is accurate to about a tenth of a second. Exit codes are as for `screen-test`.

### Options for `record`

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--project` | required | The capture project folder. Created if it does not exist. |
| `--source` | `synthetic` | Where picture and sound come from: `screen` (your real screen, with sound, Windows only) or `synthetic` (a built-in test source that makes fake picture and sound and works anywhere). |
| `--display` | 1 | With `--source screen`: which display (1 is the main display). |
| `--region` | none | With `--source screen`: record only part of the display, as four whole numbers in pixels from the display's top left corner: how far from the left, how far from the top, the width and the height, for example `100,200,1280,720` (commas or spaces). It is checked before the countdown: a region that cannot be read, reaches past the display, or is smaller than 64 by 64 is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2, with the reason in words. An odd width or height is made one pixel smaller (H.264 needs an even size) and a `region` check says so. The part is cut out of each picture before it is encoded. `take.json` records it (see the project format, `region`). |
| `--window` | none | With `--source screen`: record just one window instead of a display: its number from the `windows` command, or part of its title or program name (capital letters do not matter). A choice that fits no window or several windows is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2, listing what matched or what is open; `--window` with `--region` is refused the same way. Windows' capture delivers only that window, whatever is in front of it, so nothing else on the screen (other windows, notification pop-ups, the taskbar) is in the video. The video has the size the window has when recording begins, made even and at least 64 by 64. If the window is resized, its picture is made smaller to fit and centred on black (never made larger, so text stays sharp). If it is minimized, its last picture stays until it is restored. If it is closed the recording stops at once with a `media-failed` error that says so and that everything recorded until then has been kept. A `check` named `window` says in words what will be recorded and what happens in each of those cases. `take.json` names the source `window:` and the program, such as `window:notepad.exe`. |
| `--camera` | `none` | With `--source screen`: a webcam to record too, into `webcam.mp4` beside the screen video (story A2): its number from the `cameras` command, part of its name (capital letters do not matter), `default` for the first, or `none` to record no webcam. **A camera is off unless asked for.** A choice that fits no camera or several is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2, listing what matched or what exists. With `--source synthetic` it is refused too (`bad-option`), so that nobody thinks a webcam is being recorded when it is not. The camera is started during the countdown; one that will not start, or sends no picture in 5 seconds, ends the session before anything is recorded, with a message that says why and how to record without it (leave out `--camera`). A camera that stops during the recording (unplugged, or taken by another program) does **not** stop the recording: a `warning` named `webcam-stopped` is sent at once, the screen and the sound carry on, and the webcam video ends where the camera stopped. The picture is about 1280 by 720 at up to 30 a second, as the camera offers. |
| `--interactions` | `off` | With `--source screen`: whether to keep a private log of what the author does while recording (story A6): `off` keeps nothing; `no-keys` keeps where the cursor goes, each click, the title, program and place of the window in front, and the name and kind of the item clicked; `on` keeps those and the keys pressed, never from a password field. **It is off unless asked for.** Any other word is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2, naming the three. With `--source synthetic` it is refused too (`bad-option`), so that nobody thinks it is being noted. Before the countdown the program sends one `check` named `interactions` that explains in plain words what is noted, where it is kept (the take's `events.jsonl`, never published), that nothing is noted while paused, how to read or delete it (the `interactions` command), and, at `on`, how passwords are treated; and as each countdown begins (every take, also after `restart`) it sends a `check` named `interactions-on` with a short sentence and sounds the `interactions` cue. State reports carry `"watching":true` while recording time runs (see `state`). With `no-keys` the program installs no keyboard hook at all. A computer that will not allow the hooks ends the session before anything is recorded, with a message that says so and how to record without it (leave out `--interactions`). After the recording a `check` named `interactions-log` says in words what was kept, without printing the keys. |
| `--fps` | 30 | With `--source screen`: pictures per second in the video. |
| `--bitrate-kbps` | 8000 | With `--source screen`: video quality, in kilobits per second. |
| `--microphone` | `default` | With `--source screen`: which microphone to record: its number from `audio-devices`, part of its name (capital letters do not matter), `default`, or `none` to record no microphone. |
| `--mic-gain-db` | 0 | With `--source screen`: make the microphone louder (positive) or quieter (negative) by this many whole decibels in the mix inside the video (from -40 to 20; about 6 decibels is double or half the volume). `mic.wav` is never changed. |
| `--strict` | off | Count the summary findings (see `run-*` below) as part of passing or failing, for long test recordings. Without it they are only reported. |
| `--system-gain-db` | 0 | The same for the computer's sound, for example `-10` to make it quieter. `system.wav` is never changed. A number outside the range is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2. |
| `--output` | `default` | With `--source screen`: whose sound to record: the sound that a sound output is playing (the computer's own sound, including a screen reader's speech). Chosen the same way; `none` records none of it. Left as `default`, the recording follows Windows when it moves the sound to another output during the take (headphones plugged in or out): it asks Windows every 250 ms which output is the default and moves when two looks agree, or at once when the output being listened to breaks, ending the take only if no other output appears within 5 seconds. A number or part of a name is kept to, with an `output-changed` warning afterwards if Windows moved the sound. |
| `--cues` | `on` | Whether the recorder makes a short sound for each step, so an author who cannot see the screen always knows what it is doing (story A4). `on` or `off`; anything else is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2. See "The cue sounds" below. OpenStage may pass `off` if it plays sounds of its own. |
| `--outline` | `on` | With `--region`: whether a thin orange frame is shown on the screen just outside the region from the start of the countdown until the take ends, so the author can see what is being kept. `on` or `off`; anything else is refused with `bad-option` and exit code 2. The frame is outside the region and its window is marked to be left out of screen captures (Windows 10 version 2004 and later), so it is never in the video. Where the region touches the edge of the display, that side of the frame is off the display and not shown. With the region as the whole display there is no frame. |
| `--cue-volume` | 70 | How loud the cue sounds are, 0 (silent) to 100. A number above 100 is refused. |
| `--plain` | off | Print sentences for a person instead of JSON events. No `hello` line is printed in this mode. |
| `--demo-script` | none | Instead of reading commands on standard input, follow a script such as `pause@7000;resume@9000;marker:look here@11000;stop@13000`: commands with times in milliseconds from the start of the session (the countdown included). For demos and tests. |
| `--countdown-ms` | 3000 | Countdown before recording starts. 0 turns it off. With `--source screen` the countdown is also when the program gets ready: it starts the screen capture and the sound and wakes the video encoder (by making and throwing away a small file in the computer's temporary folder), so that recording starts when the countdown ends. A problem with the screen or a sound device is therefore reported when the countdown starts, before any take exists. With no countdown, all of that happens at the start of the take instead. |
| `--segment-ms` | 2000 | Recording time per segment file. |
| `--flush-ms` | 1000 | How often data is forced to disk. A crash loses at most this much. |
| `--duration-ms` | none | Stop by itself after this much recording time (tests and demos). |
| `--ignore-stdin-eof` | off | Keep recording if standard input closes. By default, closing standard input stops the recording cleanly. |
| `--title` | empty | Title stored in a new project. |
| `--language` | `en-US` | Language stored in a new project. |

### The cue sounds

With `--cues on` (the default) the recorder makes a short sound for each step, itself, because OpenStage's own announcements may not be heard while another program is in front. Each is under 400 milliseconds and plays through the computer's default sound output at `--cue-volume`. They are told apart by shape, not only by pitch:

| Sound | What it is | What it sounds like | Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| countdown | once a second from the start of the countdown | one very short high beep | 50 ms |
| start | the countdown is over; recording begins when it ends | three rising notes, the last longer | 340 ms |
| pause | recording is paused | two falling notes | 240 ms |
| resume | recording carries on | two rising notes | 240 ms |
| stop | the recording is finished and closed | three falling notes, the last low and long | 340 ms |
| error | something went wrong and the recording ended | two low, rough buzzes | 340 ms |
| interactions | what the author does is about to be noted (only with `--interactions no-keys` or `on`) | four soft notes that go up, stay and come back down | 320 ms |

Rules the program keeps:

* **No cue is ever played while recording time is running**, so none is recorded. The countdown beeps play during the countdown; the start sound plays at the end of the countdown and recording begins only after it has ended (plus 60 ms); the pause sound plays once the recording is paused; the resume sound plays while still paused and recording carries on only after it has ended; the stop and error sounds play after every file has been closed. Whatever the microphone and the computer's sound captured meanwhile is thrown away, as at any start-up.
* Waiting for the start and resume sounds is not recording time. `--countdown-ms` is the time before the start sound, so recording begins about 0.4 seconds after the countdown ends. With `--cues off` there is no such wait.
* Starting again (`restart`) counts down again, with beeps, once the old take is closed. A marker makes no sound. Stopping during the countdown plays the stop sound and no start sound.
* A cue that cannot be played never stops a recording. The `state` events remain the primary signal; the sounds are an addition, and `cue-test` lets a person hear them without recording.
* The `interactions` sound plays once as each countdown begins (or before the start sound, with no countdown), together with the `interactions-on` check, and never while recording time runs. It is neither rising (on) nor falling (off), so it is not mistaken for the start or the stop.
* Before the countdown, `record --source screen` sends one `check` named `cues` saying that the sounds are on and at what volume.

## 3. Events (program to OpenStage)

Every event has an `event` field that names its type.

### `hello`
Always the first line.
```json
{"event":"hello","protocol":"0.1","program":"openstage-capture","programVersion":"0.1.0","platform":"windows"}
```

### `probe`
The answer to the `probe` command. Lists each source and whether it can be used on this computer. `note` is plain language for people. On Windows, each real display is listed as `display:1`, `display:2`, and so on, with `available` true and a note giving the command to record it (`record --source screen --display N`). Each camera is listed as `camera:1`, `camera:2`, and so on, with a note giving the command to record it with (`record --source screen --camera N`).
```json
{"event":"probe","platform":"windows","sources":[{"id":"synthetic","available":true,"note":"A built-in test source."}]}
```

### `state`
The recorder changed state, or is repeating its state (about once a second, so a late reader catches up).
```json
{"event":"state","state":"recording","elapsedMs":1500,"take":1}
```
When the recorder is also noting what the author does with the mouse and keyboard (`--interactions`), the report while recording carries `"watching":true`; the field is left out when false, and it is false while paused, in the countdown and after the end, because nothing is noted then. Show or speak it wherever the state is shown or spoken ("Recording, interaction recording is on"), so the indicator is not only something seen. With `--plain` the sentence for recording ends with "Interaction recording is on."
`state` is one of `idle`, `countdown`, `recording`, `paused`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `error`. `elapsedMs` counts recording time only: **time spent paused is not counted**. During the countdown it is 0. `take` is the take number (starting at 1) that the report belongs to: during a countdown it is the take about to begin, and in `stopped` and `error` it is the take just finished. It is 0 only if the program stopped before any take began.

### `level`
A sound level, sent while recording about twice a second: the loudest moment since the last one. `source` is `mic` (the microphone) or `system` (the computer's own sound). `peak` runs from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (loudest). `text` is a plain-language description for people who cannot see a meter: `silent`, `quiet`, `good`, `loud`, or `too loud`.
```json
{"event":"level","source":"mic","peak":0.5,"text":"good","elapsedMs":10}
```

### `warning`
Something worth knowing that did not stop the recording.
```json
{"event":"warning","code":"not-paused","message":"Resume only works while paused."}
```
Codes in use: `interactions-dropped` (the computer was too slow to answer for a moment, so some of the author's mouse and keyboard activity was not noted; sent once per take; the video and sound are not affected), `interactions-no-accessibility` (Windows' accessibility information could not be started, so the names of clicked items are not noted and, at `on`, no letters, digits or symbols are noted either), `bad-command`, `not-recording`, `not-paused`, `recover-problem`, `webcam-stopped` (the webcam stopped sending pictures while the recording carries on: when, and why in words; sent once, as soon as the program notices, with no sound, because a sound played while recording would be recorded), and `slow-save` (the recording loop itself waited 100 milliseconds or more for the disk just now, with how long; a slow disk can make the video stutter), and `slow-disk` (sent when a take ends: the drive was slow, 100 milliseconds or more, to confirm saves of the take's notes `events.jsonl`, how many of how many and the longest; the notes are written from a thread of their own, so the recording did not wait for them, and the advice is to record onto a faster drive if the video still stutters), and `track-silent` (a sound track of a finished recording holds only silence: sent after the recording, with advice that fits the microphone or the computer's sound), `output-changed` (after a recording with the computer's sound on an output chosen by number or name: Windows now sends sound to a different sound output than the one chosen, so the rest of the sound may be missing; not sent when the output was left as the default, which is followed), `sound-went-quiet` (the computer's sound was heard but then silent for the last minute or more of the recording, with when it went quiet; this is how a move to an output that was not listened to looks), `echo-likely` (the microphone seems to be hearing the speakers), `echo-unchecked` (the two files could not be read to look for one), `balance-off` (the computer's sound is as loud as the voice or louder, with the change to try), and `balance-unchecked`.

### `error`
Something went wrong. If `fatal` is true, the program is stopping, and it still tries to leave every file complete.
```json
{"event":"error","code":"write-failed","message":"The disk is full.","fatal":true}
```
Codes in use: `write-failed` (a file could not be written), `media-failed` (the screen or the video encoder failed; the message says why), `source-unavailable`, `bad-demo-script`, `project`, `not-implemented`.

### `marker`
A marker was added at this point of the recording.
```json
{"event":"marker","label":"oops","elapsedMs":4200}
```

### `takeSetAside`
The author started again. The old take is **set aside, not erased**, and a new one begins.
```json
{"event":"takeSetAside","take":1,"nextTake":2}
```

### `recovered`
`recover` repaired an interrupted take. `maxLossMs` is the most recording time the repair could have lost (the flush interval).
```json
{"event":"recovered","take":1,"durationMs":4000,"maxLossMs":1000,"segments":3}
```

### `check`
One finding from a test or setup check, in plain language. Sent by `windows` (as `windows` and `window`), `pick-region` (as `region-chosen`), `screen-test`, `video-test`, `video-crash-test`, `audio-test`, `find-output`, `timing-test`, `recorder-crash-test`, and `video-info`; and by `record --source screen`, which sends `region` before the countdown when `--region` was given (which part of the display, and anything that was changed, in words), `cues` (when the sounds are on), `camera` before the countdown when `--camera` was given (which camera, and in words how it is recorded), `interactions` before the countdown when `--interactions` was `no-keys` or `on` (what is noted, in plain words), `interactions-on` as each countdown begins, `interactions-log` after the recording (what was kept, in words), `sound-devices` before the countdown (which microphone and which sound output were chosen, in words) and, just before `result`, the readback checks: `video-size` (with a region: the pictures in the saved video must be exactly the region's size), `video-readback` (Windows opens the saved video the way a player would and the length it reads must match the recording time to within 0.7 seconds), `audio-readback` (the same for the video's sound track, sent only when sound was recorded), `webcam-readback` (the same for `webcam.mp4`, sent only when a webcam was recorded: as long as the recording to within 0.7 seconds, or, when the camera stopped, no longer than the moment it stopped and not empty), and `microphone-file` and `system-sound-file` (the separate sound files hold sound as long as the recording, to within 0.3 seconds, and the loudest moment is said in words), then `balance` and `echo` (the same two checks as in `audio-test`, from the two saved files; it never changes the exit code, because an echo is for the author to know, not a fault of the recorder; with `--plain`, such a finding that found something is said as `Note:` instead of `PROBLEM:`, and the warning that carries the same advice is not said a second time). Last come the summary findings, from counters the recorder keeps while it works: `run-summary` (length, pictures written, steps of the steady 30 pictures a second that had to be skipped because the program was late, pictures Windows threw away while recording, how many it delivered in all and the most it took at one look, which can be more than the 8 the waiting line holds because more arrive while it is emptied; fails above 1 percent skipped), `run-cpu` (processor use as a share of one core and of this computer, with a projection for a 4-core laptop; fails above 10 percent of this computer; and, when the recorder measured it, where the picture work's time went for every second of the recording: bringing pictures from the graphics card into memory, handing them to the video writer, the recording thread's own processor time, and at least how much of the total is outside those steps. These are wall-clock times, so they are upper limits), `run-stalls` (how often the program went more than 100 ms without looking at the screen and the sound, the longest wait, and for the worst few what the program had just been busy with (the picture, the sound, saving to disk, and of the sound's time how much was writing sound into the video file); fails if any wait was longer than 250 ms or there was more than one wait over 100 ms a minute), `run-memory` (memory at the start and the most used; fails if it grew by more than 300 megabytes, which would be a leak), `run-interactions` (sent only when interactions were noted: how many cursor positions, clicks, clicked item names, window changes and keys were noted, with the reasons when there were no keys or no names, and how many happenings were thrown away because the computer was too slow; fails only if nothing at all was noted), `run-webcam` (sent only when a webcam was recorded: its size and rate, how many pictures the video holds, how many the camera sent and the longest wait between two, how long after being taken the pictures reached the program on average and at most, and whether each was placed where its camera time stamp says it was taken, which is what keeps the webcam with the voice; when a camera's time stamps cannot be used the pictures are placed when they arrive, and it says so; fails if the camera stopped, if the video holds fewer than 98 percent of the pictures a video of that length should, or if the camera went more than a second without a picture; its processor and memory are part of `run-cpu` and `run-memory`), and `run-sound-microphone` and `run-sound-system` (how far each sound card ran from the computer's clock, what the program corrected (sound that is always waiting beyond the clock, more than 20 ms at its lowest across two stretches of 2 seconds in a row, is cut back to 5 ms with the join smoothed over 10 ms; sound missing by more than 40 ms is made up with silence), and at worst how much later or earlier than its picture the sound played, and when; fails beyond 40 milliseconds. The computer's sound is judged only on playing late: a quiet computer sends no sound at all, which looks the same as sound arriving early. When the recording followed Windows to another sound output, `run-sound-system` also lists each move with its time, and it fails if a move could not be made). These only decide the exit code with `--strict`. While recording, the program also writes a line about memory and processor use to standard error once a minute. With `--source screen` the program looks at the screen and the sound every 5 milliseconds (the default for other sources is 20): a steady 30 pictures a second needs a look at least every 33 milliseconds, and Windows' sleeping is coarse enough that a 20 millisecond wait can become 30 or 45. The setup checks of the recorder will use it too.
```json
{"event":"check","check":"screen-capture","ok":true,"message":"Received 151 pictures in 5.0 seconds from Display 1, 1920 by 1080, main display. Each picture is 1920 by 1080 pixels."}
```
`check` names what was checked, `ok` says whether it was fine, and `message` says what that means for a person.

### `progress`
How far a long job has got, in words, so that someone who cannot see a progress bar can hear it. Sent by `render` about every tenth of the way and at the end. `percent` is 0 to 100. A new event: a reader that does not know it ignores it, as for every event.
```json
{"event":"progress","task":"export","percent":40,"message":"Exporting: 40 percent (360 of 900 pictures)."}
```

### `result`
The last line of a `record` or `recover` run.
```json
{"event":"result","ok":true,"project":"C:\\Courses\\lesson.capture","take":1,"state":"complete","durationMs":12000,"segments":6}
```
`segments` is how many media files the take holds. `state` is the final state of the take: `complete`, `recovered`, `error` (then `ok` is false), or `none` (the program stopped before any take was started, or `recover` found nothing to repair).

## 4. Commands (OpenStage to program)

Every command has a `cmd` field.

| Command | Example | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `pause` | `{"cmd":"pause"}` | Stop recording time without ending the take. Only valid while recording. |
| `resume` | `{"cmd":"resume"}` | Continue after a pause. Only valid while paused. |
| `stop` | `{"cmd":"stop"}` | Finish cleanly: make every file complete, then print `result`. |
| `restart` | `{"cmd":"restart"}` | Start again: set this take aside (never erased) and begin a new one with the same settings. Only valid while recording. |
| `marker` | `{"cmd":"marker","label":"oops"}` | Add a marker. `label` is optional. Only valid while recording. |

A command used in the wrong state gets a `warning`, and nothing else changes.

## 5. What happens when things go wrong

| Situation | What the program does |
|---|---|
| OpenStage closes standard input (it quit or crashed) | Stops cleanly and finishes the take. (Unless `--ignore-stdin-eof`.) |
| Nobody is reading standard output any more | Finishes the take cleanly and exits. |
| A write to disk fails (disk full, drive removed) | Prints a fatal `write-failed` error, completes what it can, exits with code 1. |
| The program is killed or the computer loses power | The take stays in state `recording`. `recover` repairs it later and loses at most `--flush-ms` of recording. |
| A command line is empty | Ignored. |
| A command line is not valid, or too long | A `bad-command` warning. Recording continues. |

## 6. What OpenStage must do

- Start the program with standard input and standard output **piped**, and read standard output **as it arrives**, not only at the end. (This is request OS-4 in [openstage-requests.md](openstage-requests.md).)
- Read standard error too, or send it to a log, so the pipe never fills.
- Never rely on the order of fields in a line.
- Show every state change and level in text, not only visually (the recorder panel is built that way).
