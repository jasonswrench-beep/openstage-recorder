echo   OpenStage Capture: record only part of the screen
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This records 8 seconds of just a RECTANGLE of one display, then opens
echo the video so you can see that only that rectangle is in it. The
echo rectangle is given as four numbers, measured in pixels from the top
echo left corner of the display:
echo.
echo   how far from the LEFT, how far from the TOP, the WIDTH, the HEIGHT
echo.
echo For example 100,200,1280,720 is a rectangle 1280 wide and 720 tall,
echo starting 100 pixels from the left edge and 200 from the top.
echo.
echo To choose the rectangle by dragging it on the screen, run CHOOSE
echo REGION.bat first. If you did, this script offers that choice.
echo.
echo While it records, a thin orange frame is shown just OUTSIDE the
echo rectangle from the countdown until the end, so you can see what is
echo being kept. It is not in the video. Windows also draws its own thin
echo frame around the WHOLE display to show that the screen is being
echo recorded; that one is Windows, not this program, and is not in the
echo video either.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: this records part of your screen. It is saved only on this
echo computer, in the folder region-test-output next to this file. Nothing
echo is sent anywhere. No sound is recorded in this test.
