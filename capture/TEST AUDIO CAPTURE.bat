echo   OpenStage Capture: try recording sound
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This checks that Windows will let the program hear TWO things on
echo your computer, and saves what it heard so you can listen:
echo.
echo   1. your MICROPHONE (so it can record your voice)
echo   2. the SOUND YOUR COMPUTER IS PLAYING (so it can record a video,
echo      a program, or a screen reader that is speaking)
echo.
echo This test records sound only: no picture and no video.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: the sound files contain your voice and whatever your computer
echo was playing. They are saved only on this computer, in the folder
echo audio-test-output next to this file. Nothing is sent anywhere. You
echo can delete the folder afterwards.
echo.

call "%~dp0rust-setup.bat"
if errorlevel 1 goto no_rust

echo Getting the program ready. The first time this can take a few minutes.

echo.
echo These are the microphones and sound outputs on this computer:
echo.
"%~dp0target\release\openstage-capture.exe" audio-devices --plain
echo.
echo WHICH MICROPHONE? Type its number from the list above and press Enter,
echo or just press Enter to use the one marked as the default.
set "MIC="
set /p MIC=Microphone number: 
echo.
echo WHICH SOUND OUTPUT? This is where the sound you want to record is
echo playing, for example your speakers or your headphones. Type its number
echo and press Enter, or just press Enter for the default. Not sure which
echo one it is? Close this window and double-click FIND SOUND OUTPUT.bat first.
set "OUT="
set /p OUT=Sound output number: 
echo.
echo WHAT TO DO (before it starts):
echo   - Start some sound playing on your computer, for example a video,
echo     a song, or a talking web page. Keep it playing.
echo   - If you can, use headphones, so your microphone does not also hear
echo     the speakers.
echo.
echo WHAT TO DO (during the 8 seconds):
echo   - SAY a sentence out loud, clearly, such as "Testing, one two three,
echo     this is my voice."
echo.
echo It starts in 8 seconds.
timeout /t 8 /nobreak >nul
echo Listening now. Say your sentence...

echo.
echo The program could not be built. The last lines of the log follow.
echo Please send me the file audio-test-log.txt from this folder.
echo.
echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
