echo   OpenStage Capture: where is the sound coming out?
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo A computer can have many sound outputs: speakers, headphones, a
echo monitor with speakers, and virtual ones made by other programs.
echo Windows lets the recorder listen to ONE of them at a time, so it has
echo to know which one you are actually listening through.
echo.
echo This listens to ALL of them at once while something plays, and tells
echo you which one carries the sound, and its number. Type that number when
echo TEST AUDIO CAPTURE.bat asks which sound output to use.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: nothing is saved and nothing is sent anywhere. It only
echo measures how loud each output is.
echo.

echo WHAT TO DO: start something playing on your computer that you can
echo HEAR, for example a video or some music, and keep it playing until
echo this finishes. Listen through the speakers or headphones you normally use.

echo It starts in 8 seconds.

echo Please send me the file find-output-log.txt from this folder.

echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
