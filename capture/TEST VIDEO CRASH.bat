echo   OpenStage Capture: what survives a crash?
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo A recording is only trustworthy if a crash or a power cut does not
echo lose it. This test checks that on YOUR computer:
echo.
echo   1. The program starts recording a video of your main screen.
echo   2. After about 8 seconds it is stopped WITHOUT WARNING, the way a
echo      crash or a power cut would stop it. Only this test's own
echo      recording program is stopped. Nothing else on your computer is
echo      touched.
echo   3. The program then looks at what was saved, repairs the file, and
echo      tells you how many seconds survived.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: the saved video shows whatever was on your screen. It stays
echo on this computer, in the folder video-crash-output next to this file.
echo Nothing is sent anywhere. You can delete the folder when you are done.
echo.

echo 15 seconds, for example drag a window around. There is nothing else
echo to do. It starts in 5 seconds.

echo Please send me the file video-crash-log.txt from this folder.

echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
