echo.
echo This checks that Windows will let the program see your screen,
echo and how smoothly the pictures arrive. It does NOT make a recording
echo yet. It saves two still pictures of your main screen so you can
echo look at them.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: those two pictures show whatever was on your screen. They
echo are saved only on this computer, in the folder screen-test-output
echo next to this file. Nothing is sent anywhere. You do not need to
echo send them to anyone, and you can delete the folder when you are done.

echo WHAT TO DO: for the next 8 seconds the program watches your main
echo screen. Please keep something moving the whole time, for example
echo drag a window around, or play a video. A still screen sends very
echo few pictures, which is normal but tells us nothing.

echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
