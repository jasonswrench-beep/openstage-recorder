rem cargo-run.bat: runs cargo and writes everything it says to a log file.
rem
rem The other scripts call it like this:
rem     call "%~dp0cargo-run.bat" the-log.txt build --release -p openstage-capture-cli
rem The first word is the log file, the rest is what cargo is asked to do.
rem The exit code is 0 when it worked, 1 when it did not, and 2 when the
rem libraries were missing and you chose not to download them.
rem
rem It first tries WITHOUT downloading anything. A computer that already
rem has the libraries this program is built from (Rust keeps them in
rem .cargo\registry in your user folder) never downloads. If some are
rem missing, it says so and asks before downloading them, once, from
rem crates.io, the Rust libraries website.
