echo ============================================================
echo   OpenStage Capture: does the recording follow the sound?
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo When you plug in headphones, or pick another sound output in Windows,
echo the sound moves. The recorder is meant to move with it. This test
echo records for 70 seconds and asks you to switch the sound output twice,
echo to see whether it really does.
echo.
echo WHAT YOU WILL DO:
echo   1. Start some music or a video playing, loud enough to hear, and
echo      leave it playing the whole time. Wear headphones if you have
echo      them (plug them in only when the screen tells you to).
echo   2. Press a key here. A 5 second countdown starts, then it records.
echo   3. When this window says SWITCH NOW (about 20 seconds in), send the
echo      sound to your OTHER output. Either plug headphones in or out, or
echo      click the speaker icon next to the clock and pick another output.
echo   4. When it says SWITCH BACK (about 45 seconds in), switch again.
echo   5. Leave everything alone until it says it has finished.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: this records your screen, your voice and your computer's
echo sound. It is saved only on this computer, in the folder
echo switch-test-output next to this file. Nothing is sent anywhere.

echo.
echo The sound output is left to Windows on purpose, so the recorder can
echo follow it. Before you go on, make sure the output you are using now
echo is the one Windows has chosen (the speaker icon next to the clock).
echo.
echo Start your music now. Then press any key to begin.
