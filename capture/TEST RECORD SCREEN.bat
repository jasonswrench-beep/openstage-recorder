echo ============================================================
echo   OpenStage Capture: a real recording, with sound
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This is a test of the real recorder, the same program that OpenStage
echo will use. It follows a script, so you only watch and talk:
echo.
echo   - a 3 second countdown, then it records your main screen,
echo     your MICROPHONE, and the SOUND YOUR COMPUTER IS PLAYING
echo   - a marker is added about 2 seconds in
echo   - it PAUSES for about 2 seconds, then RESUMES
echo   - a second marker is added
echo   - it STOPS, finishes the video file, and checks everything
echo.
echo Time spent paused is not recorded, so the finished video should be
echo about 8 seconds long, not the 14 seconds this takes. (The short sounds
echo the recorder makes for the countdown, start, pause, resume and stop
echo are not recorded either. You will hear them.)
echo.
echo PRIVACY: the recording shows your screen and holds your voice and
echo whatever your computer played. It is saved only on this computer, in
echo the folder record-test-output next to this file. Nothing is sent
echo anywhere. You can delete the folder afterwards.
echo.

echo These are the microphones and sound outputs on this computer:
echo.
"%~dp0target\release\openstage-capture.exe" audio-devices --plain
echo.
echo WHICH MICROPHONE? Type its number and press Enter, or just press Enter
echo for the default.
set "MIC="
set /p MIC=Microphone number: 
echo.
echo WHICH SOUND OUTPUT? This is where the sound you want to record plays,
echo for example your speakers or headphones. Type its number and press
echo Enter, or just press Enter for the default. Not sure? Close this window
echo and double-click FIND SOUND OUTPUT.bat first. To record no computer
echo sound at all, type none.
set "OUT="
set /p OUT=Sound output number: 
echo.
echo BALANCE, optional. The mixed sound inside the video can make one sound
echo quieter or louder. Type a number of decibels, for example -10 to make
echo the computer's sound quieter, or just press Enter to leave it as heard.
echo About 6 decibels is half the volume. The separate files mic.wav and
echo system.wav are never changed, so you can always start again from them.
set "SYSGAIN="
set /p SYSGAIN=Computer sound change in decibels: 
if "%SYSGAIN%"=="" set SYSGAIN=0
set "MICGAIN="
set /p MICGAIN=Microphone change in decibels: 
if "%MICGAIN%"=="" set MICGAIN=0
echo.
echo WHAT TO DO:
echo   - Keep something moving on your main screen the whole time, for
echo     example drag a window around.
echo   - Start some sound playing, for example a video or a song, and keep
echo     it playing. If you can, wear headphones, so your microphone does not
echo     also hear the speakers and make an echo.
echo   - SAY a sentence out loud while it records, such as: Testing, one two
echo     three, this is my voice.
echo.
echo It starts in 8 seconds.
