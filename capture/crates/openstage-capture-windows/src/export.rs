//! Exporting an edit as a finished MP4 (story F1).
//!
//! [`export`] runs the whole job: it makes the plan from the edit, then for every frame of the finished video it
//! draws the frame (the render crate) and hands it to the video writer, and mixes the sound for the same stretch
//! of time and hands that over too. The pieces that need Windows (reading frames out of the recorded videos, drawing
//! text, writing the MP4) are passed in, so the flow, and every message a person will read, is tested here with fakes.
//!
//! * **Atomic.** The video is written to `name.part.mp4` and renamed to `name.mp4` only when it is whole. A
//!   cancelled or failed export deletes the `.part.mp4` file and leaves any earlier `name.mp4` exactly as it was. There
//!   is never a half-finished file under the real name.
//! * **Cancellable.** The caller is asked before every frame whether to stop.
//! * **The same every time.** Frames are drawn with arithmetic that is the same everywhere, and the sound is mixed
//!   with whole numbers, so the same edit and the same recordings hand the video writer exactly the same pictures
//!   and sound. (Whether the writer's own encoder then gives the same bytes is up to Windows' encoder.)
//! * **Frame by frame, sound by frame.** Each frame's sound is the stretch of time between it and the next frame,
//!   cut on whole sample boundaries, so no sound is skipped or repeated at a frame's edge.
