//! * It goes only into the take's own `events.jsonl` (see `docs/capture-project-format.md`), which is never published,
//!   and the author can read it in words and delete it (`interaction_review` in `openstage-capture-project`).

//! What Windows does (hooks that tell this program about every click and key, and the accessibility information that

//! a Windows computer, is: how often the cursor is written, which keys are written, what a position means, and
//! how Windows' clock is matched to recording time.
