//! Recording a real screen into a take, as one crash-safe MP4 file.
//!
//! [`ScreenMedia`] plugs into the session engine (`openstage-capture`) the way the test source
//! does, so countdown, pause, resume, start again, markers, and stop all work through the same
//! protocol. Each take holds one file, `screen.mp4`, written by Windows' own video tools as a
//! fragmented MP4: a setup box and then a short, self-contained fragment about every second, so a
//! recording cut off by a crash still plays up to the last whole fragment.
//!
//! Recording time does not advance while paused, so the video simply has no gap where the pause was.
//! The screen sends a picture only when something changes; the newest picture fills each beat of a
//! steady frame rate (see [`Pacer`]).
