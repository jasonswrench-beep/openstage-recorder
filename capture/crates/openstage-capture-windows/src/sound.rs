//! Recording sound together with the screen.
//!
//! Each take can hold two sound sources: the microphone and the sound the computer itself is playing
//! (including a screen reader's speech). Both are laid onto the recording clock by [`AudioAligner`], so
//! they are exactly as long as the picture, and are then stored twice:
//!
//! * as separate WAV files, `mic.wav` and `system.wav`, which the editor needs (for example to remove
//!   an echo when the microphone also heard the speakers); and
//! * mixed into one AAC sound track inside `screen.mp4`, which is what every player plays.
//!
//! The recording clock stands still while paused, so sound heard during a pause is thrown away. Sound
//! captured while the recorder was starting up is thrown away too: recording time starts only when
//! everything is ready.
