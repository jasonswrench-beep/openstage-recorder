//! Screen capture for Windows, and the checks that prove it works on a given computer.
//!
//! The real capture uses Windows Graphics Capture (Windows' own screen capture service, the same
//! one the Windows Snipping Tool uses) and exists only when built for Windows. Everything around
//! it (the checks, the statistics, the picture files) is ordinary code that is tested anywhere,
//! with a fake [`Platform`] standing in for Windows.
//!
//! This crate does not record to a capture project yet. [`run_screen_test`] only proves that
//! pictures arrive, how steadily, and that they show the screen.
