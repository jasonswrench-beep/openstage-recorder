//! The capture project folder.
//!
//! A recording lives in its own folder (named `something.capture`) beside the
//! course, never inside it. The folder holds a small manifest (`capture.json`)
//! and one folder per *take* under `takes/`. A take holds its media either as
//! one crash-safe fragmented MP4 written by Windows (`screen.mp4`, listed in
//! `take.json`) plus separate WAV sound files for the microphone and the computer's own
//! sound, or, for the test source, in small checksummed pieces called
//! segments, plus an append-only log of interactions.
//!
//! Everything here is built so that a crash costs seconds, not the take:
//!
//! * a segment is written as `seg-000001.part` and renamed to `.seg` only when
//!   it is complete, and every record carries a checksum;
//! * the state of a take lives in exactly one place, its own `take.json`, and
//!   the manifest never lists takes, so the two cannot disagree after a crash;
//! * nothing is ever erased: a take the author starts over is only marked as
//!   set aside.
//!
//! The format is described in `docs/capture-project-format.md`.
