//! Drawing pictures: the pixels of one frame of the finished video.
//!
//! A [`Canvas`] is a picture the size of the video, blue-green-red-unused bytes, rows from the top. Everything
//! that goes into a frame is drawn on one: the recorded screen (copied or resized), a blurred or blacked-out
//! region, shapes and arrows. Text is drawn by Windows' own text drawing (see `text.rs`), because it has the
//! fonts and knows how to lay out every language.
//!
//! **Every drawing step uses only whole numbers or the arithmetic every computer does the same way (add,
//! subtract, multiply, divide, square root).** A frame drawn twice from the same pictures is the same bytes,
//! and a video exported twice is the same video (story B3). Nothing here depends on the computer it runs on,
//! so all of it is tested on any computer, pixel by pixel.

/// A colour: red, green, blue.
