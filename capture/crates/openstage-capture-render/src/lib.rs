//! Turning an edit into a finished video: the plan.
//!
//! The editor (TypeScript) saves what the author decided as `edit.json`. Rendering has three parts:
//! working out, for every frame of the finished video, which pictures are shown where and how far the
//! zoom has moved (this crate); drawing those pictures (later, with Windows' video tools doing the
//! decoding and the encoding); and mixing the sound (the sums are here, the files are read by the
//! caller). Everything in this crate is plain arithmetic, so it is tested here without any video.
//!
//! Nothing here reads or writes a file.
