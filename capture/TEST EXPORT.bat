echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This records about 12 seconds of your screen and your voice (and
echo your webcam if you choose one), then turns the recording into a
echo finished MP4 file. To prove the drawing works, the video gets one
echo of everything added to it:
echo   - a title in the top left,
echo   - a red box, a yellow ellipse and a green arrow,
echo   - a blurred patch and a blacked-out patch on the right,
echo   - a zoom into the top left quarter near the end,
echo   - and the webcam in the bottom right corner, if you chose one.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: this records your screen and your voice. Everything is
echo saved only on this computer, in the folder export-test-output next
echo to this file. Nothing is sent anywhere.

echo   - the blurred patch: is the text under it unreadable?
echo   - the blacked-out patch: solid black?
echo   - the zoom near the end: smooth, into the top left quarter,
echo     with the blur and the blackout still hiding the same words?
echo   - the webcam in the bottom right corner, the right way up?
echo   - your voice, and does it match what you see?
