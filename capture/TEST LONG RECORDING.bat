echo ============================================================
echo   OpenStage Capture: a long recording
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo Short tests can pass while a long recording quietly goes wrong: the
echo program grows, falls behind, or sound drifts away from the picture a
echo little more each minute. This records for as long as you choose and
echo then reports on exactly those things.
echo.
echo While it runs, use your computer as you normally would. Open
echo programs, type, scroll, play some sound now and then, and talk once
echo in a while. In the middle it PAUSES for 20 seconds and RESUMES, to be
echo sure that works over a long recording too. You will hear the
echo recorder's short sounds for the countdown, start, pause, resume and
echo stop; they are not recorded.
echo.
echo BEFORE YOU START:
echo   - Make sure Windows will not go to sleep or turn the screen off
echo     for the whole time (Settings, System, Power).
echo   - Leave about 6 gigabytes of free disk space for a 60 minute test.
echo     It is a real recording of your screen and voice.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: the recording shows your screen and holds your voice. It is
echo saved only on this computer, in the folder long-test-output next to
echo this file. Nothing is sent anywhere. Delete the folder afterwards.

set "OUT="
set /p OUT=Sound output number: 

echo.
echo WILL YOU BE AWAY? Type Y and press Enter to leave the computer alone
echo for the whole test. The script then keeps Windows awake, plays a
echo gentle looping sound through your default sound output, and shows a
echo window with things moving in it, so the recording has real picture
echo and sound without you. For that sound to be recorded, answer the
echo sound output question above with just Enter. Press Enter alone if
echo you will use the computer yourself, as before.

echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
