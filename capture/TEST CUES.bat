echo   OpenStage Capture: the recorder's own sounds
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo While you record, the recorder makes a short sound for each step, so
echo you always know what it is doing even if you cannot see the screen.
echo This plays all of them, one at a time. Before each sound, this window
echo says in words what it is about to play.
echo.
echo   - the COUNTDOWN: one very short high beep, once a second
echo   - the START: three rising notes. Recording begins when they end.
echo   - a PAUSE: two falling notes
echo   - a RESUME: two rising notes
echo   - the STOP: three falling notes, the last one low and long
echo   - an ERROR: two low, rough buzzes
echo.
echo None of these sounds is ever recorded. They only play while the
echo recording is not running: during the countdown, while paused, and after
echo the stop.

echo   - Could you hear every one? Was any too quiet, too loud or unpleasant?
echo   - Could you tell them apart without looking at the lines above?

echo     word as well?
echo Each sound was also saved as a file in the folder cue-test-output next
