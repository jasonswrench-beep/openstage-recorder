echo   OpenStage Capture: try making a video of your screen
echo ============================================================
echo.
echo This makes an 8 second MP4 video of your main screen with Windows'
echo own video tools, then reports how smoothly it went and how hard
echo your computer worked. There is NO SOUND yet: sound comes later.
echo.
echo PRIVACY: the video shows whatever was on your screen. It is saved
echo only on this computer, in the folder video-test-output next to this
echo file. Nothing is sent anywhere. You do not need to send it to anyone,
echo and you can delete the folder when you are done.

echo WHAT TO DO: for the next 8 seconds the program records your main
echo screen. Please keep something moving the whole time, for example
echo drag a window around, or play a video. Then, for the best test of
echo your computer, do it again with a busy screen, such as a video
echo playing full screen.

echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
