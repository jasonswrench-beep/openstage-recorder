echo You do not need to do anything while it works. A full log is saved

echo   SUCCESS. The program was built.

echo It is here:

echo Quick check that it starts and can say what it can record:
echo.

echo The list above is what this computer can record. Next, double-click
echo CHECK MY COMPUTER.bat to see whether it is ready to record, and
echo then try the TEST scripts one at a time.

echo   1. Go to  https://rustup.rs
echo   2. Download and run rustup-init.exe
echo   3. Press Enter to accept the default choices. If it offers to
echo      install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools, say yes.

echo HINT: if the error says something was not found, or that a variant is
echo missing, this folder is probably a MIX of old and new files. That can
echo happen when a new ZIP is extracted over an old folder and some files
echo are skipped. Fix: extract the ZIP into a NEW, empty folder and run the
echo script from there.
