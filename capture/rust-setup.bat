rem rust-setup.bat: makes sure the program called cargo (or another
rem program, named after the call) can be found.
rem
rem The other scripts in this folder call this first, like this:
rem     call "%~dp0rust-setup.bat"
rem     if errorlevel 1 goto no_rust
rem or, to look for Node.js instead of cargo:
rem     call "%~dp0rust-setup.bat" node
rem It changes nothing permanent: the PATH it sets lasts only until the
rem script that called it ends. It installs nothing and needs no
rem administrator rights.
rem
rem 1. If the program is already on the PATH, that is all.
rem 2. Some computers have Rust installed but deliberately not on the
rem    PATH, with a helper that sets things up when asked. If this file
rem    exists, it is used:  C:\Dev\tools\rust-env.ps1
rem    (to use a helper somewhere else, set the variable
rem    OPENSTAGE_RUST_ENV to its full path first)
rem 3. Otherwise, a normal install is tried: Rust in your user folder
rem    (.cargo\bin), or Node.js in Program Files.
