"""Signs Windows program files with Azure Artifact Signing, and timestamps every signature.

  python tools/sign_windows.py FILE...              sign each file that is not signed yet, then check it
  python tools/sign_windows.py --description TEXT FILE...   the same, with the program name written into the signature
  python tools/sign_windows.py --leave-list LIST FILE...   the same, but a file named in LIST (one place per line, such as
                                                    python/Lib/site-packages/pip/_vendor/distlib/t64.exe) is left unsigned on purpose
  python tools/sign_windows.py --check FILE...      only check: each file must carry a valid signature and a timestamp
  python tools/sign_windows.py --ready              say whether everything signing needs is here, and sign nothing

The same file is used by each OpenStage tool's installer build: for the programs it packs, and, one file at a time through Tauri's
bundle.windows.signCommand or Inno Setup's SignTool, for the program itself, the installer's plugins, the uninstaller and the setup file.
In OpenStage Author, tools/build_installer.py --sign does all of that; in OpenStage Recorder, app/tools/build_installer.py --sign.

Why the timestamp is not optional: an Artifact Signing certificate is valid for three days. A signature without a timestamp stops validating when its
certificate runs out, so a file is only counted as signed here when its signature is valid AND timestamped.

The account details come from environment variables, so they never go into the repository:
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_ENDPOINT   the account's regional address, for example https://eus.codesigning.azure.net/
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_ACCOUNT    the Artifact Signing account's name
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_PROFILE    the certificate profile's name (a Public Trust profile)
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_PUBLISHER  optional: the name the signature must show (the verified identity); a file signed by anyone else fails the check
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_DLIB       optional: Microsoft's Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll (x64), from the NuGet package Microsoft.ArtifactSigning.Client;
                            by default <your folder>\\Tools\\artifact-signing\\bin\\x64\\Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll
  OPENSTAGE_SIGNTOOL        optional: signtool.exe (x64); by default the newest one in the Windows SDK, 10.0.22621 or later
  OPENSTAGE_SIGN_DRY_RUN=1  print the commands instead of running them, and check nothing (for tests)

Signing in: Microsoft's signing library finds the sign-in itself (Azure's DefaultAzureCredential). On a person's own computer that is `az login`,
once; nothing secret is stored by this script.
